# HardWareSwapGet

This script gets deals, offers, and whatever kind of content from /r/hardwareswap and put its into a ".txt" file and also sends a notification with those deals through email

#Usage

In order to use it (in linux) you'll need to run it as $ ./HardWareSwapGet.py &.
If you want to bring it to the foreground just use 'fg'
If you want to be able to close that terminal use $ nohup ./HardWareSwapGet.py &.
In order to see the process again (but not it's output) use: $ ps aux | grep HardWareSwapGet.py
